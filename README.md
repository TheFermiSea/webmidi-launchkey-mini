## Vision

This synthesizer was developed with the aim of performing chiptune music live. The idea would be to have 4 musicians use MIDI instruments to perform each of the 4 monophonic channels that a Nintendo/NES can play.

You can read more about that project on the following document (in French): [Edu-concert 8-bit / chip tune](https://hackmd.io/nszFj8pcTAynVP04-GUePw)

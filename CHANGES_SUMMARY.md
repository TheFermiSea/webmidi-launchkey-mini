# Changes Summary: Fixed Oscilloscope Branch

## Branch Information
- **Source**: [TraceBivens/webmidi-launchkey-mini](https://github.com/TraceBivens/webmidi-launchkey-mini) (master)
- **Fixed Branch**: `fixed-osc`
- **Commit**: `9e0ad2a`

## Problem Statement
The original WebMIDI oscilloscope had several critical issues that made it unsuitable for educational use:

1. **Horizontal Jitter** - Waveform constantly shifted horizontally, preventing accurate measurements
2. **Incomplete Screen Filling** - At higher time resolutions, waveform didn't fill entire screen
3. **Inaccurate Time Base** - Time resolution controls didn't provide precise scaling
4. **Poor Multi-Frequency Support** - Only showed last played frequency, not all active notes
5. **Missing Trigger Modes** - Auto/Single/Normal modes didn't work properly

## Solution Overview

### Core Architecture Change
**Before**: Attempted to analyze Web Audio API buffers directly  
**After**: Mathematical waveform generation with real audio envelope using Web Audio's precise timing

This fundamental shift eliminates timing synchronization issues between JavaScript and Web Audio clocks.

## Key Improvements

### ✅ **Zero Horizontal Jitter**
- Implemented fixed phase reference system
- Eliminates continuous phase drift from `audioContext.currentTime`
- Rock-solid waveform stability for precise measurements

### ✅ **Always Fills Screen**
- Smart interpolation ensures full-width display at all time resolutions
- Works from 0.5ms/div to 50ms/div settings
- Maintains waveform accuracy through linear interpolation

### ✅ **Accurate Time Base**
- Consistent pixel-per-sample calculations
- 20-division grid system matching professional oscilloscopes
- Adaptive FFT buffer management for optimal performance

### ✅ **Multiple Frequency Display**
- Tracks all simultaneously playing notes
- Shows individual frequencies for educational analysis
- Real-time frequency management with start/stop events

### ✅ **Professional Trigger Modes**
- **Auto**: Continuous monitoring with silence detection
- **Single**: Capture and hold for waveform study
- **Normal**: Traditional trigger level-based display
